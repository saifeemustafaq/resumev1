## Experience Overview: Harness.io
- Technical Product Manager (Developer Relations Council)
- Harness Platform Team

**Tenure:** January 2024 – August 2024

### 1. Product Strategy & Vision Development  
**Key Metric:** 30% increase in API adoption; 25% growth in Harness developer community  

#### Context and Challenge  
Developer adoption is crucial for platform scalability, but we were competing in saturated DevOps tooling market, this required differentiation beyond just technical capabilities. The core challenge for us (the Platform Team) was aligning the platform’s enterprise-grade infrastructure with the frictionless, self-service expectations of modern developers. Our metrics showed that only 35% of registered developers actively used Harness APIs beyond initial exploration, and through user research we found that this is a significant gap because of awareness and sustained engagement.

#### Execution Framework  
- **Market Positioning:** I was given five companies to conduct competitive analysis of CI/CD and DevSecOps platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab and so on) to identify developer needs. Prioritized **“shift-left security”** as a strategic differentiator, integrating automated vulnerability scanning directly into pipeline configuration workflows.
- **Community-Driven Roadmap:** Implemented a transparent public roadmap using GitHub Discussions, allowing developers to propose and vote on features. This resulted in 12 high-priority community requests being fast-tracked, including Terraform provider enhancements and Kubernetes namespace isolation controls.
- **Technical Evangelism Program:** Partnered with Harness solution architects to create a “Certified Harness Developer” credential program, combining modular learning paths on Harness University with hands-on certification labs. Over 1,200 developers completed certifications in Q2 2024, with 68% subsequently contributing to Harness-related open-source projects.

#### Outcome Validation  
The 30% API adoption increase was measured through **OAuth token retention rates** (from 35% to 65% over six months) and **pipeline execution frequency** (2.1x more daily API calls per active user). Community growth was tracked via Slack and Discord MAU (Monthly Active Users), which expanded from 8,500 to 10,600 through gamified participation tiers offering early access to beta features.

### 2. User Experience Optimization  
**Key Metric:** 40% reduction in onboarding time; 35% increase in developer satisfaction  

#### Problem Space Analysis  
Initial user testing revealed that developers spent 55+ minutes configuring their first Harness pipeline due to fragmented documentation, unclear error handling, and lack of prebuilt templates for common use cases (e.g., AWS ECS deployments). Support tickets related to environment setup accounted for 29% of all DevRel team inquiries.

#### Technical Implementation  
- **GitHub-Centric Onboarding:**  
  - Built **Harness DevSpaces**, leveraging GitHub Codespaces’ cloud IDE integration to provide preconfigured environments with Harness CLI, SDKs, and sample pipelines. Reduced local setup from 18 manual steps to a single-click workflow.
  - Implemented **context-aware documentation** using ReadMe.io, dynamically surfacing guides based on the user’s active GitHub repository language (e.g., Go developers saw Kubernetes blue-green deployment examples).
- **Friction Logging:** Instituted a weekly “friction audit” process where DevRel engineers recorded pain points during pair programming sessions with new users. Top issues were triaged via a weighted scoring model combining frequency, severity, and business impact.

#### Measurable Impact  
Post-optimization, Time-to-First-Pipeline (TTFP) decreased from 53 minutes to 32 minutes (39.6% improvement), calculated through Mixpanel user journey analytics. Developer satisfaction (measured via quarterly NPS) rose from +28 to +41, with qualitative feedback highlighting appreciation for GitHub-native tooling and reduced cognitive load during initial exploration.

### 3. Technical Documentation & Spec Writing  
**Key Metric:** 50% reduction in support tickets  

#### Documentation Architecture  
- **Interactive API Playground:** Developed a React-based sandbox embedded into Harness API docs, allowing developers to execute endpoints directly from the browser with preconfigured auth headers and sample payloads. Integrated real-time error analysis using OpenTelemetry to surface common misconfigurations.
- **SDK Modularization:** Restructured Python and JavaScript SDKs into discrete feature modules (e.g., `harness-pipeline-builder`, `harness-security-scan`), reducing installation size by 62% and improving tree-shaking compatibility. Published automated compatibility matrices for Node.js (v14+) and Python (3.8+).

#### Validation Process  
- **Contribution Guardrails:** Implemented a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for docs that enforced:
  - OpenAPI schema validation using Spectral rules
  - Code sample test coverage via embedded Jest/Pytest suites
  - Link integrity checks to prevent broken references
- **Feedback Loop:** Introduced doc “kudos” buttons allowing developers to highlight helpful sections, which were factored into quarterly writer performance reviews. Over 1,800 positive annotations were recorded in Q2 2024, with security policy guides being the most praised.

### 4. Community Engagement  
**Key Metric:** 10 community-contributed plugins from 3 hackathons  

#### Program Design  
- **Technical Scaffolding:**  
  - Preconfigured hackathon starter kits with Harness Plugin SDK, including CI/CD templates for automated testing and SonarQube quality gates. Provided dedicated Kubernetes clusters via Harness Cloud for resource-intensive projects.
  - Implemented a **GitHub Achievement System** recognizing milestones like “First Plugin Merge” and “Security Champion,” with badges displayed on participant profiles.
- **Judging Framework:** Assembled a panel of Harness engineers and DevRel leaders using weighted scoring across:
  - **Technical Depth** (30%): Integration complexity, test coverage
  - **Business Alignment** (25%): Relevance to Harness platform priorities
  - **Community Value** (25%): Potential for broad adoption
  - **Innovation** (20%): Novel use of emerging tech (e.g., WASM, eBPF)

#### Post-Event Integration  
- **Plugin Marketplace:** Launched a curated directory for hackathon submissions, featuring automated security scans and compatibility checks. Top plugins were adopted by 14% of enterprise customers within three months.
- **Maintainer Onboarding:** Created a Maintainer Guidebook detailing contribution workflows, including how to request Harness Cloud credits for performance testing. Assigned senior engineers as mentors for high-potential projects.
