## 3. Deloitte Case Competition: Digital Health Platform (team of 5)

> My Role: I led the development of a digital health platform prototype, integrating telemedicine, EHR, and AI-driven analytics to enhance healthcare access. I focused on business model development, compliance with healthcare regulations, and ensuring a user-friendly design for both patients and doctors, while collaborating closely with the team to balance technical, financial, and design elements.

- **Technical Execution**: Designed a prototype for a comprehensive digital health platform that integrates telemedicine appointments, electronic health records (EHR), and AI-driven health analytics. The concept was built on a microservices architecture to ensure components for video consultations, medical record exchange, and AI health insights could scale independently. We paid special attention to interoperability by aligning with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards, allowing our platform to pull patient data from different hospital systems and wearable devices seamlessly. For the prototype, we demonstrated how a patient’s wearable fitness data could be analyzed by a machine learning model to flag potential health issues and share that information with doctors during a virtual visit.

- **Product Strategy & Compliance**: Developed a go-to-market strategy targeting regions with limited healthcare access, positioning the platform as a global telehealth solution that adapts to local needs. This included segmenting users by region (for example, focusing on rural areas in Asia for initial rollout where doctor availability is low, versus urban markets in Europe where convenience is the selling point). We also outlined revenue streams like subscription plans for healthcare providers and freemium services for patients. Throughout the project, compliance was a major focus: we researched and incorporated requirements to meet HIPAA standards in the US, GDPR in Europe, and various telemedicine regulations in target countries. The plan detailed how user data would be encrypted and stored regionally to satisfy data sovereignty laws. We conducted competitive benchmarking against industry leaders like Teladoc and Amwell, identifying differentiation opportunities such as an AI-powered personalized wellness plan feature that those competitors didn’t emphasize.

- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Proposed key metrics to track the platform’s success and iteratively improve it. These included user engagement statistics (average session duration of telehealth calls, frequency of logins to view health stats), conversion rates (percentage of free users upgrading to paid plans or booking a second appointment), and health outcomes measures (patient follow-up compliance rates, self-reported symptom improvements). We created a hypothetical dashboard showing these metrics and used it to perform cohort analysis in our case study: for instance, comparing the behavior of chronic care patients vs. first-time acute care users. This analysis informed product recommendations, such as introducing specialized chronic care management features for long-term patients who had much higher login frequencies and different needs than one-time users.

- **Leadership & Collaboration**: In our team of five, I spearheaded the business model development and ensured all proposals were grounded in financial and regulatory reality. I coordinated closely with the team member acting as the technical lead to align our API integration plan with legal requirements (e.g., making sure our use of a third-party video call API complied with healthcare privacy laws and that all data transmissions would be encrypted). At the same time, I worked with our design lead to craft an intuitive patient and doctor user experience, bridging the gap between complex healthcare data and user-friendly design. We held interdisciplinary meetings to iterate on the platform’s mock-up, ensuring that business, tech, and design considerations were balanced. In the final round of the Deloitte case competition, we presented a polished pitch to a panel of judges, showcasing a compelling story of how our platform could be implemented. We highlighted financial projections, a risk mitigation plan for compliance issues, and a roadmap for scaling - convincing the evaluators of both the platform’s viability and our team’s preparedness to handle real-world challenges.

- **User-Centric Development**: Mapped out the end-to-end journeys for both patients and doctors using our platform. For patients, we illustrated steps from symptom logging, to AI triage suggestions, to booking a virtual doctor appointment, to post-visit follow-up with personalized health tips. For doctors, we detailed how they would receive concise patient histories and AI-generated health flags before a consultation, conduct the video call with easy access to the patient’s records, and then update the consultation notes that integrate back into the EHR. We created low-fidelity prototypes of the user interface and conducted informal usability tests by simulating a telehealth consultation among team members. This led to several UX improvements - for example, simplifying the appointment scheduling process (fewer clicks to book a slot) and improving the layout of medical data so doctors could scan important patient information at a glance. By focusing on these user workflows, we ensured our proposed platform was not just technologically sound and compliant, but also genuinely user-friendly and tailored to real healthcare scenarios.
