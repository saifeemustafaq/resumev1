## 1. AWS Disaster Response Hackathon (team of 3)

> My Role: I led the development of an AI-powered mobile app for disaster prediction, utilizing machine learning and real-time data for risk assessment and alerts. I focused on product strategy, ensuring GDPR compliance and product roadmapping, while also conducting user testing to refine the app's interface for emergency responders and at-risk residents.

- **Technical Execution**: My team developed an AI-powered mobile app for natural disaster prediction using Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab. The app integrated machine learning models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) for wildfire risk assessment, leveraging real-time weather data, satellite imagery via NASA’s MODIS API, and historical fire patterns. Geolocation-based alerts were implemented with AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to notify users in designated high-risk zones in real time.

- **Product Strategy & Compliance**: I focused on usability for emergency response teams and residents in high-risk areas, ensuring the solution addressed their specific needs. Emphasized data privacy and GDPR compliance by designing an anonymized data pipeline and securing user information through AWS Cognito authentication and encryption protocols. Defined clear OKRs for the product (e.g., reduce evacuation notification time by 20%) and prioritized accessibility features (such as offline mode and multi-language support) to ensure inclusivity during emergencies.  

- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: My role also included collecting engagement metrics like user sign-ups, alert acknowledgment rates, and response times to warnings. Evaluated the ML model’s accuracy using confusion matrices and precision-recall analysis to ensure reliable predictions. Incorporated user feedback through a pilot test with a local disaster management organization, using their input to fine-tune the risk thresholds and alert messaging for greater effectiveness.  

- **Leadership & Collaboration**: Took on the role of product lead in a team of three, coordinating the project’s business viability assessment and legal compliance checks. Worked closely with the two engineer teammates to embed regulatory considerations (e.g., data protection laws and emergency communication regulations) without sacrificing development speed. Facilitated regular team stand-ups and brainstorming sessions to keep everyone aligned on goals. In the final presentation to hackathon judges, highlighted the product’s social impact, scalability, and how our cross-functional collaboration enabled rapid development of a compliant, life-saving solution.  

- **User-Centric Development**: I developed primary user personas (such as an emergency responder and an at-risk resident) and mapped out their user journeys from risk detection to evacuation. This helped the team design intuitive interfaces, like a clear dashboard for responders and simple alert prompts for residents. Conducted quick usability tests (think-aloud sessions with classmates acting as end-users) to refine the app’s UI/UX - for example, simplifying the alert confirmation process and improving the visibility of evacuation routes on the in-app map.
